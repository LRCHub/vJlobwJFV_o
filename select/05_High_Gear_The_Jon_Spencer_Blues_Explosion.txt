Loading up my truck
A big teen wheeler
Carryin' lots of candy cane
Stockin' up more than a mistletoe
Ask anybody that you want
Ask any cat that you happen to know
Well I drink more eggnog than malt liquor
I'm gonna get you with that cocoa

That's right man

Clearing off my driveway
Using lots of rock salt
Dead racoon and a possum
Spread out all over the asphalt
That's when I see those little tiny reindeer
Caught up in the glare of my headlights

Well I put on my gloves and I took that pill
I'm gonna shift it through to high gear
That's right

Yeah
Up in high gear baby
Ah! High gear
Up in high gear
High gear!

Oh!

Lost all control
Way up in a snow drift
Hot coffee in my lap
Thinking about a law suit
If you ever see me coming
You better get on the side of the road
Baby I won't stop to think for one god damn second
'Cause I'm carrying such a heavy load
That's right man
