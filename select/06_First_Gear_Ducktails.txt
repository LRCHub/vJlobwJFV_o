I've tried to play it down
The pain i've hid so well
Since you pulled out the driveway last year

I know it was my fault
Which drove you off the lot
But I sense our love's in first gear

I just wanted you to be here
Wanted to feel you near me
To see life from the front seat

Nothing on earth comes close
To driving with you on the road
Accelerate our love
Shift the gear stick up
I wish that I could show you
Just how I've fixed her up
I wasn't in my best shape last year

And you can take forever
There's no rush to get here
But when you see my exit
Turn right there
