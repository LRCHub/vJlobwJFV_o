I eat food to satisfy my hunger
I drink water to quench my thirst
I use my mouth and air to blow balloon up
I prick with pin to watch it burst
To make noise I use my breathe
To unlock doors I use a key
And when I'm looking for something I use my eyes
I use booze to unlock me

I wear shoes so I can run
As to avoid the broken glass

I wear the pants because they suit me

And to discourage the pinchin' of my ass
I'll tell a joke to make you laugh
I'll close the door to have a cry
They say that change and pain is a positive thing
Have I changed since you died
Don't ask me why I smoke
But I drink to get drunk
Don't ask me why I smoke

I don't know
But I drink to get drunk

Don't ask me why I smoke

But I drink to get drunk
Don't ask me why I smoke
I don't know

But I drink to get drunk
I eat food to satisfy my hunger
I use my mouth and air to blow balloon up
To make noise I use my breathe
And when I'm looking for something I use my eyes
I use booze to unlock me
I eat food to satisfy my hunger
I use my mouth and air to blow balloon up
